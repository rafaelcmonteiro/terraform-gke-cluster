 # This is my first terraform for Google Cloud

I'll use the tutorial: [link to the tutorial](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/gke)

__TODO__:

- Create a GKE Cluster using terraform
- Create a basic helm chart to install a basic application.
- Use the tutorial to add annotation to the deployment of this application to generate a load balancing: vide tutorial [Load Balancing](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/https)

PS: using the best practices for terraform of this [tutorial best practices](https://cloud.google.com/docs/terraform/best-practices-for-terraform)
